### üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

The database consists of several key entities that represent the core components of the Airbnb Clone application:

#### **Users**

* `id`: Unique identifier for each user.
* `username`: The user's chosen display name.
* `email`: The user's email address (must be unique).
* `password`: Encrypted password for login.
* `is_host`: Boolean to distinguish between hosts and guests.

#### **Properties**

* `id`: Unique identifier for each property.
* `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the host (user).
* `title`: Title of the property listing.
* `description`: Detailed description of the property.
* `location`: Geographic location of the property.

#### **Bookings**

* `id`: Unique identifier for each booking.
* `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the guest (user).
* `property_id`: Foreign key referencing the booked property.
* `check_in`: Date of arrival.
* `check_out`: Date of departure.

#### **Reviews**

* `id`: Unique identifier for each review.
* `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the reviewer.
* `property_id`: Foreign key referencing the reviewed property.
* `rating`: Numeric score (e.g., 1-5).
* `comment`: Textual feedback from the user.

#### **Payments**

* `id`: Unique identifier for each payment.
* `booking_id`: Foreign key referencing the associated booking.
* `amount`: Total payment amount.
* `status`: Payment status (e.g., pending, completed).
* `payment_date`: Timestamp of the transaction.

**Entity Relationships**:

* A **user** can create multiple **properties**.
* A **property** can receive multiple **bookings** and **reviews**.
* A **booking** is made by a user for a specific property.
* A **review** is submitted by a user for a specific property.
* A **payment** is linked to one booking.

### üîê API Security

Security is a critical aspect of any web application, especially one that handles sensitive user data and financial transactions. The following measures will be implemented:

* **Authentication**: Ensures that only registered users can access protected resources. This will be implemented using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
* **Authorization**: Restricts access to specific actions based on user roles. For example, only hosts can manage property listings.
* **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a certain time period.
* **Input Validation**: Protects against injection attacks and ensures only valid data is processed.
* **HTTPS Encryption**: Ensures all data in transit is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.

**Why Security Matters**:

* **User Data**: Protecting personal information such as email, address, and payment details builds trust with users.
* **Payments**: Secure handling of transactions is vital to avoid fraud and ensure compliance with financial regulations.
* **System Integrity**: Preventing unauthorized access helps maintain a stable and fair environment for all users.

### üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** pipelines are automated workflows that streamline the process of testing, building, and deploying code. They help ensure that changes to the codebase are reliably and efficiently integrated, tested, and delivered to production environments.

**Importance for the Project**:

* **Consistency**: Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing human error.
* **Faster Development Cycles**: Developers receive quick feedback on their changes, allowing for rapid iteration and delivery.
* **Improved Collaboration**: Teams can work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other's progress.
* **Reliability**: Automated testing and deployment reduce the chances of bugs reaching production.

**Tools to be Used**:

* **GitHub Actions**: For automating tests, builds, and deployments directly from the GitHub repository.
* **Docker**: To containerize the application, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
* **Heroku / Render / Railway (optional)**: For automated deployment and hosting of the application.

The CI/CD pipeline will help maintain high code quality and ensure a seamless deployment experience throughout the development lifecycle.
